Yi Camera based Motion Detection Notifications without using ffmpeg sensor

I implemented this because:
(a) I couldn't figure out how to get ffmpeg sensor to work reliably, and
(b) the camera already captures motion detection so it seemed worthwhile to try and use it.

This is based on the Yi v1 camera with the Yi Hack: https://github.com/fritz-smh/yi-hack

New Updated Scheme - Feb 25, 2017

1) Yi Camera captures motion events and saves the video to the Camera's SD Card
2) Copy the video of the motion to an ftp server - optional
3) send motion notification to mqtt topic via hass api
4) leverage whatever notification component you like in HA to receive notification of motion

1) video is saved to /home/hd1/record - nothing else to be done here except cleanup old files.

2) Once the video is captured, we just need to move it to an ftp server.  The Yi Hack includes two scripts - one to delete old videos,
the other to copy video files to an ftp server.  The scripts are located in /home/hd1/test/scripts.  I used the copy-to-ftp script as is -
just fill out the 5 lines at the top of the file with specifics of your ftp server.  I have an ftp account setup on my freenas box which i use.
Alternatively, you can do this on your HA box if you have the capacity...  see notes below on setting up ftp on ubuntu.

3) Linux on the Yi is an embedded linux which is pretty minimalist. No curl or mosquitto client.  Fortunately, HA has an mqtt publish api which
can be used.  The trick is to emulate an http POST via netcat on the Yi.  Alternatively, if you're using EMQ mqtt broker, that also has an
mqtt publish api.  on the Yi camera, edit /home/hd1/test/check_motion.sh as follows:

-after the line: 'echo $motion_file | sed "s/.\//record\//" > /home/hd1/test/http/motion' insert:

  if [ $motion_file != "" ]; then
    body='{"payload": "{\"camera\":\"living room\",\"date\":'"\\\"`date +%x`\\\""',\"time\":'"\\\"`date +%I:%M%p`\\\""'}", "topic": "MOTION TOPIC", "qos": 0, "retain": 0}'
    body_len=$(echo -n "$body" | wc -c)
    head="POST /api/services/mqtt/publish HTTP/1.0\r\nHost: YOUR.HA.IP.ADDR:8123\r\nUser-Agent: curl/7.47.0\r\nAccept: */*\r\nx-ha-access: YOUR_HA_PASSWORD\r\nContent-Type: application/json\r\nContent-Length: ${body_len}\r\n\r\n${body}"
    echo -ne $head | nc -i 5 YOUR.HA.IP.ADDR 8123
  fi

  where payload is your motion detection message - a text rendition of whatever json string you want to send as the motion detection message.
  (it doesn't have to be json, but i used json since it was easy to parse in my HA motion sensor - see step 4.)
  in above, for example, payload is "{"camera":"living room","date":"02/26/17","time":"2:00pm"}"

  - substitute the IP address of your HA instance for YOUR.HA.IP.ADDR
  - substitute an mqtt topic to which you will publish alarm messages for MOTION TOPIC
  - substitute your HA password for YOUR_HA_PASSWORD

  if above head variable doesn't work for you, can you use a full featured linux environment with curl to figure out the the right string:
  curl --trace-ascii - -0 var=val -X POST -H "x-ha-access: YOUR_HA_PASSWORD" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"payload": "{\"camera\":\"living room\",\"date\":\"02-15-2017\",\"time\":\"20:13\"}", "topic": "MOTION TOPIC", "qos": 0, "retain": 0}' http://YOUR.HA.IP.ADDR:8123/api/services/mqtt/publish
  which will echo back the exchange between HA's api and your curl instance.. modify the head variable above as needed.

-save the check_motion.sh file and reboot the Yi.

4) Set up an mqtt sensor in HA to include in a front end group:

for example:
- platform: mqtt
  state_topic: "homeassistant/motion"
  name: "LR Motion Detection"
  unit_of_measurement: "Date"
  value_template: '{{ value_json.date ~ "\n" ~ value_json.time }}'

Set up an automation to send notifications based on published messages:
the condition here is used to only send notifications when i'm not home.
for example:

- alias: 'motion detected'
  trigger:
    platform: mqtt
    topic: 'homeassistant/motion'
  condition:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: device_tracker.jays7_galaxy_s7
      state: 'not_home'
  action:
    service: notify.notify
    data_template:
      message: "motion detected: {{ trigger.payload_json['camera'] ~ ' ' ~ trigger.payload_json['time'] ~ ' ' ~ trigger.payload_json['date'] }}"

Thats pretty much it except for cleanup of files on the Yi... since i copy them to the ftp server, i run the /home/hd1/test/scripts/delete_old_videos.sh script on the Yi

camera to delete videos every 2 days.  I slightly modified that script to run every 2 days and delete any videos older than 2880 minutes.

You may also need to do the same thing for the contents of /home/hd1/record_sub.  the script is only written to act on /home/hd1/record.

ftp setup notes:
-i am running hass on a full desktop, 8 core machine, so i run the ftp server on this same machine.
-set up a user with only ftp access - ie, no shell access.  see here: http://www.faqs.org/docs/securing/chap29sec295.html
-i am running ubuntu 16.04, so followed this to enable ftp: https://www.ostechnix.com/install-vsftpd-server-ubuntu-16-04-lts/

--------this is the old scheme:
The basic sequence of operations is:

1) Yi Camera captures motion events and saves the video to the Camera's SD Card
2) Copy the video of the motion to an ftp server that can detect new file additions
3) Based on detection of new file on ftp server, publish an mqtt message to an mqtt sensor topic subscribed to by your HA user
4) leverage whatever notification component you like in HA to receive notification of motion

1) The Yi Camera automatically captures and saves to the SD card a short video clip when there is motion.  You can use this video
to generate a notification.  One could probably just compile a mosquitto client onto the Yi's SD card, but I didn't want to spend time
figuring that out - if you do, please let me know how to do it.  Video from motion events is automatically saved to /home/hd1/record
and sometimes /home/hd1/record_sub.

2) Once the video is captured, we just need to move it to an ftp server.  The Yi Hack includes two scripts - one to delete old videos,
the other to copy video files to an ftp server.  The scripts are located in /home/hd1/test/scripts.  I used the copy-to-ftp script as is -
just fill out the 5 lines at the top of the file with specifics of your ftp server, which in my case is the same host that runs my HA instance.
(I do not run on an rpi, i have an 8 core desktop machine, so plenty of cpu/disk capacity...).

3) I use a utility to watch the ftp serverfor new file additions - inotifywait - which i incorporated into the bash script below that runs at startup.
inotify-tools is available to install via apt-get on ubuntu 16.04 and available to download for debian jessie... google is your friend here.
i just run the script using cron's @reboot.  The thing about inotifywait is that it cannot monitor FUSE based file systems.  so, if you're mounting
an external device, you'll have to choose carefully.  Alternatively, you could write something find based to monitor the mounted directory
every minute or so..  Here's the script I run at startup:

notifier.sh:
----
#!/bin/bash

MAILTO=""

while inotifywait -re create /path/to/ftp/directory; do /usr/bin/mosquitto_pub -h mqtthost -u ha-user -P password -p 1883 -t 'ha/motion-video-topic' -m '{"camera":"living room","date":"'"`date +%D`"'","time":"'"`date +%H:%M`"'"}'; done
----
where: '{"camera":"living room","date":"'"`date +%D`"'","time":"'"`date +%H:%M`"'"}' is the json payload i use - {"camera": "living rooom", "date":"date-of-motion-event", "time":"time-of-motion-event"}

this will run continuously and look for creation (create event) of new files anwhere in path specified (-r = recursive, ie, watch all subdirectories of path)) and
then publish an mqtt messages as video files get copied to your ftp directory.

Optionally, set up an mqtt sensor in HA to include in a front end group:

for example
- platform: mqtt
  state_topic: "homeassistant/motion"
  name: "LR Motion Detection"
  unit_of_measurement: "Date"
  value_template: '{{ value_json.date ~ "\n" ~ value_json.time }}'

4) Set up an automation to send notifications based on published messages:
the condition here is used to only send notifications when i'm not home.
for example:

- alias: 'motion detected'
  trigger:
    platform: mqtt
    topic: 'homeassistant/motion'
  condition:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: device_tracker.jays7_galaxy_s7
      state: 'not_home'
  action:
    service: notify.notify
    data_template:
      message: "motion detected: {{ trigger.payload_json['camera'] ~ ' ' ~ trigger.payload_json['time'] ~ ' ' ~ trigger.payload_json['date'] }}"

Thats pretty much it except for cleanup of files on the Yi... since i copy them to the ftp server, i run the other script on the Yi camera to delete videos every 2 days.

I slightly modified the included delete_old_videos.sh script, which is located at /home/hd1/test/scripts, to run every 2 days and delete any videos older than 2880 minutes.

You may also need to do the same thing for the contents of /home/hd1/record_sub.  the script is only written to act on /home/hd1/record.
